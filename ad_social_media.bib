Unlike existing approaches, our algorithm uses an ensemble of statistical and heuristic classifiers to predict locations. We find that a hierarchical classification approach can improve prediction accuracy. Experimental evidence suggests that our algorithm works well in practice and outperforms the best existing algorithms for predicting the location of Twitter users.},
