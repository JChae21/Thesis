\section{Summary}
We presented a trajectory-based visual analytics system, making it possible to: 1) generate trajectories using geo-tagged Tweets, 2) discover human common movement patterns, 3) detect abnormal movements, and 4) improve human movement analysis using semantic context available from multiple online media sources.
In order to find common movements, we utilize an enhanced partition-based clustering model that allows to extract similar portion of movements.
We proposed a classification model using human expert interaction to identify abnormal movements.
We described how we effectively extract and utilize relevant context, such as keywords extracted from Tweet text, shared photos, web camera videos, and news media for providing a better understanding of spatial movement behaviors.
We demonstrated the usage and effectiveness of our system for human movement analysis in abnormal situations by case studies.
%\section{Future Work}
%For future work, since we still have visual clutter issues, we plan to investigate solutions to reduce the clutter issues.
%In addition, we will request feedback from first responders and emergency managers for the usability and effectiveness of our system.
